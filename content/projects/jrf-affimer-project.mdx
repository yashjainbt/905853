## Overview

This project explored affimer-linked therapeutic concepts within oncology-oriented experimental systems.

## Problem Statement

There is a need for robust experimental frameworks that can evaluate novel therapeutic interactions with mechanistic clarity and reproducibility.

## Approach

The work combined controlled biological experimentation, workflow standardization, and response analysis to improve confidence in preclinical interpretation.

## Tools & Techniques

In vitro studies, in vivo studies, protocol optimization, observation-driven analysis, and quality-oriented research documentation.

## Results / Outcomes

The project produced structured insights into therapeutic response behavior under controlled conditions and highlighted paths for translational extension.

## What I Learned

I developed a stronger systems perspective on integrating biological experimentation with analytical rigor and regulatory-aware documentation practices.
