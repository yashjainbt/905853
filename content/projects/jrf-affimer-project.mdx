## Overview

ANRF-funded JRF project focused on creating EGFR-targeted Affimer recombinant proteins to deliver siRNA/drug-loaded cubosomes for improved treatment of drug-resistant TNBC.

## Problem Statement

Enhance the specificity and efficacy of therapeutic delivery systems for TNBC while overcoming drug resistance.

## Approach

•	Designed experimental workflows for targeted delivery and preclinical evaluation. <br>
•	Conducted literature review to support protein and cubosome design. <br>
•	Assisted in lab setup and procurement for in vitro and in vivo studies. <br>
•	Prepared frameworks for independent experimental execution. 


## Tools & Techniques

•	Protein engineering and conjugation <br>
•	Cubosome formulation <br>
•	In vitro cell culture and viability assays <br>
•	Animal handling (subcutaneous/tail vein injections, blood collection) <br>
•	Data analysis and reporting 


## Results / Outcomes

•	Structured experimental protocols for translational studies <br>
•	Hands-on experience with preclinical in vitro and in vivo systems <br>
•	Enhanced workflow documentation and reproducibility 

## What I Learned

•	Translational research planning and execution <br>
•	Advanced laboratory techniques for targeted delivery <br>
•	Importance of regulatory compliance in preclinical studies <br>
•	Integration of literature research with experimental design
