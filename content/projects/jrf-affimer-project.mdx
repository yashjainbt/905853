## Overview

ANRF-funded JRF project focused on creating EGFR-targeted Affimer recombinant proteins to deliver siRNA/drug-loaded cubosomes for improved treatment of drug-resistant TNBC.

## Problem Statement

Enhance the specificity and efficacy of therapeutic delivery systems for TNBC while overcoming drug resistance.

## Approach

•	Designed experimental workflows for targeted delivery and preclinical evaluation.  
•	Conducted literature review to support protein and cubosome design.  
•	Assisted in lab setup and procurement for in vitro and in vivo studies.  
•	Prepared frameworks for independent experimental execution. 


## Tools & Techniques

•	Protein engineering and conjugation  
•	Cubosome formulation  
•	In vitro cell culture and viability assays  
•	Animal handling (subcutaneous/tail vein injections, blood collection)  
•	Data analysis and reporting 


## Results / Outcomes

•	Structured experimental protocols for translational studies  
•	Hands-on experience with preclinical in vitro and in vivo systems  
•	Enhanced workflow documentation and reproducibility 

## What I Learned

•	Translational research planning and execution  
•	Advanced laboratory techniques for targeted delivery  
•	Importance of regulatory compliance in preclinical studies  
•	Integration of literature research with experimental design
