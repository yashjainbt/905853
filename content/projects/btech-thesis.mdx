## Overview

This thesis focused on translationally relevant therapeutic system development at the intersection of experimental oncology and targeted delivery design.

## Problem Statement

Conventional therapeutic approaches frequently face challenges in precision, response consistency, and biological compatibility across preclinical contexts.

## Approach

A structured experimental workflow was developed to evaluate delivery strategies through iterative protocol refinement, controlled biological testing, and cross-model validation.

## Tools & Techniques

Cell culture maintenance, MTT assay, aseptic techniques, animal handling (mice & rats), and systematic laboratory documentation.

## Results / Outcomes

The project established reproducible preclinical evaluation pathways and generated interpretable findings aligned with translational decision-making.

## What I Learned

I strengthened my ability to integrate rigorous wet-lab experimentation with data interpretation, protocol optimization, and translational thinking.
