## Overview

Undergraduate thesis project assessing the cytotoxic effects of lead acetate and cobalt nitrate on MDA-MB-231 cells, combining experimental rigor with data-driven evaluation.

## Problem Statement

Investigate how exposure to heavy metals affects the viability of triple-negative breast cancer cells and identify dose-dependent cytotoxicity patterns.

## Approach

•	Cultured MDA-MB-231 cell lines under controlled conditions  
•	Applied MTT assay for cell viability measurement  
•	Designed experiments to systematically vary concentrations of lead acetate and cobalt nitrate  
•	Ensured regulatory and ethical compliance in experimental execution 


## Tools & Techniques

•	Cell culture development & maintenance  
•	MTT assay  
•	Data analysis and interpretation (GraphPad Prism10)  
•	Experimental design and documentation


## Results / Outcomes

•	Quantified cytotoxic effects of heavy metals  
•	Generated reproducible dose-response data  
•	Established a foundation for preclinical modeling skills 


## What I Learned

•	Experimental planning and rigorous execution in vitro  
•	Data interpretation and analytical reporting  
•	Importance of ethical and regulatory compliance  
•	Hands-on experience with cell culture techniques
