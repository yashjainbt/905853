## Overview

Undergraduate thesis project assessing the cytotoxic effects of lead acetate and cobalt nitrate on MDA-MB-231 cells, combining experimental rigor with data-driven evaluation.

## Problem Statement

Investigate how exposure to heavy metals affects the viability of triple-negative breast cancer cells and identify dose-dependent cytotoxicity patterns.

## Approach

•	Cultured MDA-MB-231 cell lines under controlled conditions <br>
•	Applied MTT assay for cell viability measurement <br>
•	Designed experiments to systematically vary concentrations of lead acetate and cobalt nitrate <br>
•	Ensured regulatory and ethical compliance in experimental execution 


## Tools & Techniques

•	Cell culture development & maintenance <br>
•	MTT assay <br>
•	Data analysis and interpretation (GraphPad Prism10) <br>
•	Experimental design and documentation 


## Results / Outcomes

•	Quantified cytotoxic effects of heavy metals <br>
•	Generated reproducible dose-response data <br>
•	Established a foundation for preclinical modeling skills 


## What I Learned

•	Experimental planning and rigorous execution in vitro <br>
•	Data interpretation and analytical reporting <br>
•	Importance of ethical and regulatory compliance <br>
•	Hands-on experience with cell culture techniques
